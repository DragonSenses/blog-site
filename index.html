            <p class="text-gen pb-5">Mediocrity begins if you decide not to do anything, but it is within our power to change. 
              Most people don't do things that are in alignment with their goals. Even if they have a clear dream, they don't spend even 5 minutes a day trying to be closer to that goal. 
              They also don't understand the value of time. Don't wait for the moment you are more freer, more prepared, or have a certain 
              amount of money. If you want to succeed in something, there is no perfect time to start.

              <p class="text-gen pb-5">"Blooms" is the flattering term for those who entered First High's Course 1 curriculum due to
                higher test scores in application ability, magic tolerance, and interference strength. 
                On the other hand, "Weeds" are the derogatory term applied to those who entered 
                Course 2. Although Course 1 students have personal instruction while the Course 2 
                students only study off terminals, the curriculum is the completely the same. This in no way 
                demonstrates institutional stratification  or superiority, but rather only that there is a shortage of
                instructors and faculty. Inherent magic talent can be a result of various
                factors such as genetics, opportunity, and socioeconomic status. But none of those factors can 
                outshine one's ability (domain-specific technical expertise and knowledge acquired in a field), 
                learnability (capacity to learn new things - function of IQ and curiosity),
                likability (emotional intelligence and people-skills), and drive (dispositional level of ambition).</p>

              <p class="text-gen pb-5">In the day I work as a clerk at <a href="https://spy-x-family.fandom.com/wiki/Berlint_City_Hall">Berlint City Hall</a>, 
                in the night I work as a "Contractor" for <a href="https://spy-x-family.fandom.com/wiki/Garden">Garden</a>,
                and now I'm a new loving mother for the Forger family. Each day I'm improving and finding a balance
                between work and family time. I am so lucky to have <a href="https://spy-x-family.fandom.com/wiki/Loid_Forger">Loid</a>
                as my husband and <a href="https://spy-x-family.fandom.com/wiki/Anya_Forger">Anya</a> as my daughter as they
                have been super patient with me as I adjust to my new environment. I'm not confident in my abilities
                and I'm not good at anything besides cleaning. Recently, I've been asking 
                <a href="https://spy-x-family.fandom.com/wiki/Camilla">Camilla</a> for cooking lessons so 
                I can be a better mother. I also have a impulsive tendency to solve my problems through "cleaning". 
                Despite all the challenges, having a family amidst it all is tremendously rewarding. So how can one
                balance their work and family life? Avoid distractions - even when so many things are vying for your
                attention. Be nimble - whether its free time, exercise, or work. And finally, always keep in mind of
                not what we can measure but what matters.</p>

              <p class="text-gen pb-5">Every experience, every interaction - whether pleasurable or unpleasant - will become a part of you.
                That is why we must strive for serenity, mental strength, and inner peace. The greatest tip to
                improve oneself is simply small routines - multiplied over time. The most important part 
                is keeping promises to yourself. When onset by past failures, go back over the experience when 
                you're emotionally ready and pick out the lessons. Decide how to implement 
                your daily/weekly/monthly changes. I don't believe in not thinking about failure. I prefer to 
                reframe it, own it and utilize it. You will inevitably fail more times than you succeed on the 
                way to anything substantial. The loop of intrusive thoughts will come back to haunt you, but 
                you'll know you're done with it when you can recall it without responding. Sending you strength 
                and resolve. The ultimate source of happiness is a mental feeling of joy, and not a wealth of material goods.

              <h2 class="post-title">Make Progress by Curbing Dishonest Discourse (intellectual dishonesty).</h2>
              <p class="text-gen pb-5">Dishonest discourse are subtle behaviors that impede progress, which result in a lack of intellectual 
                humility (i.e., our willingness to change). Discourse and debate are more effective in both democracy, 
                business, and life when we learn to be honest with ourselves and curb the subtle behaviors that get in 
                the way of trading real ideas.
                Dishonest discourse is one of these subtle behaviors that many people exhibit when they interact with 
                others. It's that moment when someone asks if you know a certain thing, and you say you do when you 
                really don't know it enough (or know it at all). Why do we not want to admit our ignorance in front 
                of others? When we claim to know something (but 
                really don't) just to give others the perception that 
                that we are knowledgeable or well informed, rather than honestly admitting that we do not know, 
                then that is dishonest discourse.
                Instead of answering a question we have no answer to with "I don't know" it should be "I don't know 
                the answer to that but I'll do some research. Let me get back to you on that one." Don't pretend we 
                have to know everything and don't always need to have or share an immediate opinion. This will lead 
                to more honest intellectual discourse. I used to believe that I must only rely on myself and know all
                the answers, but recently I acquired a family which made me realize new things. I've been dishonest my
                whole life, is it really ok to lower my guard and be myself again?

              <p class="text-gen pb-5">Engelbart's Law states that the intrinsic rate of human performance is exponential.
                Douglas Engelbart's work in augmenting human performance was explicitly based on the 
                realization that although we use technology, the ability to improve on improvements 
                (Bootstrapping, "getting better at getting better") resides entirely within the human sphere.
                In general, bootstrapping usually refers to a self-starting process that is supposed to 
                continue or grow without external input. To pull oneself up by one's bootstraps is a phrase 
                in the US that means: to succeed by one's own efforts or abilities. Abstraction is filtering 
                out the characteristics that are irrelevant to the heart of the problem. In CS it is the process 
                of removing elements of a code or program that aren't relevant or that distract from more 
                important elements. It refers to looking at something to maintain the general form or 
                meaning without the details.  Similar in nature to the process of generalization. Can also 
                be referred to as modeling and is closely related to the concepts of theory and design. 
                Models can be considered types of abstractions per their generalization of aspects of reality.
