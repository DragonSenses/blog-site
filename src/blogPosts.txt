Mediocrity is within our power to change. Mediocrity begins if you decide not to do anything. 
Most people don't do things that are in alignment with their goals. Most people will always be mediocre because even
if they have a clear dream, they don't spend even 5 minutes a day trying to be closer to that goal. Another thing is that
some people do not understand the value of time. Don't wait for the moment you are more freer, more prepared, have a certain 
amount of money. If you want to succeed in something, there is no perfect time to start. Do not make the dire mistake of believing
you have time to do something. Another sign of mediocrity is when they have a poor attitude to learning. They are certain in what
they know and are not willing to learn more. This keeps them in the same place while others keep growing. Keep an open
mind and be a lifelong learner.

Why there is no difference between the Blooms and Weeds üå±üå∫ üå∏üåπ

"Blooms" is the flattering term for those who entered First High in the Course 1 curriculum due to
higher test scores in terms of application ability, magic tolerance, and interference strength. 
On the other hand, "Weeds" are the derogatory term applied to those who entered Course 2. The only
difference being is that students in Course 1 have access to private lessons 
and magic teachers while the Course 2 students do not. Although Course 1 students a more in-depth 
instruction, while the Course 2 students only study off terminals, the curriculum is the completely
the same. This is in no way demonstrates institutional stratification or superiority, but rather 
only that there is a lack of availability of instructors. One's potential is not set in stone.

demonstrates institutional stratification or superiority, but rather only that there is a lack of 
available instructors and faculty. Inherent magic talent can be a result of various
factors such as genetics, opportunity, and socioeconomic status. But none of those factors can 
outshine Ability (expertise and knowledge in a field), learnability (function of IQ and curiosity),
likability (emotional intelligence and people-skills), and drive (dispositional level of ambition).

How I work two jobs and still find time for my family ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

In the day I work as a clerk at <a href="https://spy-x-family.fandom.com/wiki/Berlint_City_Hall">Berlint City Hall</a>, 
in the night I work as a "Contractor" for <a href="https://spy-x-family.fandom.com/wiki/Garden">Garden</a>,
and now I'm a new loving mother for the Forger family. Each day I'm improving and finding a balance
between work and family time. I am so lucky to have <a href="https://spy-x-family.fandom.com/wiki/Loid_Forger">Loid</a>
as my husband and <a href="https://spy-x-family.fandom.com/wiki/Anya_Forger">Anya</a> as my daughter as they
have been super patient with me as I adjust to my new environment. I'm not confident in my abilities
and I'm not good at anything besides cleaning. Recently, I've been asking 
<a href="https://spy-x-family.fandom.com/wiki/Camilla">Camilla</a> for cooking lessons so 
I can be a better mother. I also have a impulsive tendency to solve my problems through "cleaning". 
Despite all the challenges, having a family amidst it all is tremendously rewarding. So how can one
balance their work and family life? Avoid distractions - even when so many things are vying for your
attention. Be nimble - whether its free time, exercise, or work. And finally, always keep in mind of
not what we can measure but what matters.

The mind registers every event, no matter how small üß†üí≠

Every experience, every interaction - whether pleasurable or unpleasant - will become a part of you.
That is why we must strive for serenity, mental strength, and inner peace. The greatest tip to
improve oneself is quite simply small routines, multiplied over time. The most important part 
is keeping promises to yourself. When onset by past failures, go back over the experience when 
you're emotionally ready and pick out the lessons, they will be there. Decide how to implement 
your daily/weekly/monthly changes. I don't believe in not thinking about failure. I prefer to 
reframe it, own it and utilize it. You will inevitably fail more times than you succeed on the 
way to anything substantial. The loop of intrusive thoughts will come back to haunt you, but 
you'll know you're done with it when you can recall it without responding. Sending you strength 
and resolve. The ultimate source of 
happiness is a mental feeling of joy, and not a wealth of material goods. The sensory pleasure 
material things provide is generally short-lived. Such satisfaction does 
little to allay anxiety and fear. On the other hand, mental joy sustains itself.
