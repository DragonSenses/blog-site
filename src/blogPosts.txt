Mediocrity is within our power to change. Mediocrity begins if you decide not to do anything. 
Most people don't do things that are in alignment with their goals. Most people will always be mediocre because even
if they have a clear dream, they don't spend even 5 minutes a day trying to be closer to that goal. Another thing is that
some people do not understand the value of time. Don't wait for the moment you are more freer, more prepared, have a certain 
amount of money. If you want to succeed in something, there is no perfect time to start. Do not make the dire mistake of believing
you have time to do something. Another sign of mediocrity is when they have a poor attitude to learning. They are certain in what
they know and are not willing to learn more. This keeps them in the same place while others keep growing. Keep an open
mind and be a lifelong learner.

Why there is no difference between the Blooms and Weeds üå±üå∫ üå∏üåπ

"Blooms" is the flattering term for those who entered First High in the Course 1 curriculum due to
higher test scores in terms of application ability, magic tolerance, and interference strength. 
On the other hand, "Weeds" are the derogatory term applied to those who entered Course 2. The only
difference being is that students in Course 1 have access to private lessons 
and magic teachers while the Course 2 students do not. Although Course 1 students a more in-depth 
instruction, while the Course 2 students only study off terminals, the curriculum is the completely
the same. This is in no way demonstrates institutional stratification or superiority, but rather 
only that there is a lack of availability of instructors. One's potential is not set in stone.

"Blooms" is the flattering term for those who entered First High in the Course 1 curriculum due to
higher test scores in application ability, magic tolerance, and interference strength at the

students only study off terminals, the curriculum is the completely the same. This in no way 
demonstrates institutional stratification or superiority, but rather only that there is a lack of 
available instructors and faculty. Inherent magic talent can be a result of various
factors such as genetics, opportunity, and socioeconomic status. But none of those factors can 
outshine Ability (expertise and knowledge in a field), learnability (function of IQ and curiosity),
likability (emotional intelligence and people-skills), and drive (dispositional level of ambition).

How I work two jobs and still find time for my family ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

In the day I work as a clerk at <a href="https://spy-x-family.fandom.com/wiki/Berlint_City_Hall">Berlint City Hall</a>, 
in the night I work as a "Contractor" for <a href="https://spy-x-family.fandom.com/wiki/Garden">Garden</a>,
and now I'm a new loving mother for the Forger family. Each day I'm improving and finding a balance
between work and family time. I am so lucky to have <a href="https://spy-x-family.fandom.com/wiki/Loid_Forger">Loid</a>
as my husband and <a href="https://spy-x-family.fandom.com/wiki/Anya_Forger">Anya</a> as my daughter as they
have been super patient with me as I adjust to my new environment. I'm not confident in my abilities
and I'm not good at anything besides cleaning. Recently, I've been asking 
<a href="https://spy-x-family.fandom.com/wiki/Camilla">Camilla</a> for cooking lessons so 
I can be a better mother. I also have a impulsive tendency to solve my problems through "cleaning". 
Despite all the challenges, having a family amidst it all is tremendously rewarding. So how can one
balance their work and family life? Avoid distractions - even when so many things are vying for your
attention. Be nimble - whether its free time, exercise, or work. And finally, always keep in mind of
not what we can measure but what matters.

The mind registers every event, no matter how small üß†üí≠

Every experience, every interaction - whether pleasurable or unpleasant - will become a part of you.
That is why we must strive for serenity, mental strength, and inner peace. The greatest tip to
improve oneself is quite simply small routines, multiplied over time. The most important part 
is keeping promises to yourself. When onset by past failures, go back over the experience when 
you're emotionally ready and pick out the lessons, they will be there. Decide how to implement 
your daily/weekly/monthly changes. I don't believe in not thinking about failure. I prefer to 
reframe it, own it and utilize it. You will inevitably fail more times than you succeed on the 
way to anything substantial. The loop of intrusive thoughts will come back to haunt you, but 
you'll know you're done with it when you can recall it without responding. Sending you strength 
and resolve. The ultimate source of 
happiness is a mental feeling of joy, and not a wealth of material goods. The sensory pleasure 
material things provide is generally short-lived. Such satisfaction does 
little to allay anxiety and fear. On the other hand, mental joy sustains itself.

Make Progress by Curbing Dishonest Discourse (intellectual dishonesty).

Dishonest discourse are subtle behaviors that impede progress, which result in a lack of intellectual 
humility (i.e., our willingness to change). Discourse and debate are more effective in both democracy, 
business, and life when we learn to be honest with ourselves and curb the subtle behaviors that get in 
the way of trading real ideas.
Dishonest discourse is one of these subtle behaviors that many people exhibit when they interact with 
others. It's that moment when someone asks if you know a certain thing, and you say you do when you 
really don't know it enough (or know it at all). Why do we not want to admit our ignorance in front 
of others? When we claim to know something (but 
really don't) just to give others the perception that 
that we are knowledgeable or well informed, rather than honestly admitting that we do not know, 
then that is dishonest discourse.
Instead of answering a question we have no answer to with "I don't know" it should be "I don't know 
the answer to that but I'll do some research. Let me get back to you on that one." Don't pretend we 
have to know everything and don't always need to have or share an immediate opinion. This will lead 
to more honest intellectual discourse. I used to believe that I must only rely on myself and know all
the answers, but recently I acquired a family which made me realize new things. I've been dishonest my
whole life, is it really ok to lower my guard and be myself again?

Improve your life with: Bootstrapping and Abstraction.

Engelbart's Law states that the intrinsic rate of human performance is exponential.
Douglas Engelbart's work in augmenting human performance was explicitly based on the 
realization that although we use technology, the ability to improve on improvements 
(Bootstrapping, "getting better at getting better") resides entirely within the human sphere.
In general, bootstrapping usually refers to a self-starting process that is supposed to 
continue or grow without external input. To pull oneself up by one's bootstraps is a phrase 
in the US that means: to succeed by one's own efforts or abilities. Abstraction is filtering 
out the characteristics that are irrelevant to the heart of the problem. In CS it is the process 
of removing elements of a code or program that aren't relevant or that distract from more 
important elements. It refers to looking at something to maintain the general form or 
meaning without the details.  Similar in nature to the process of generalization. Can also 
be referred to as modeling and is closely related to the concepts of theory and design. 
Models can be considered types of abstractions per their generalization of aspects of reality.
