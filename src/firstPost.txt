Mediocrity is within our power to change. Mediocrity begins if you decide not to do anything. 
Most people don't do things that are in alignment with their goals. Most people will always be mediocre because even
if they have a clear dream, they don't spend even 5 minutes a day trying to be closer to that goal. Another thing is that
some people do not understand the value of time. Don't wait for the moment you are more freer, more prepared, have a certain 
amount of money. If you want to succeed in something, there is no perfect time to start. Do not make the dire mistake of believing
you have time to do something. Another sign of mediocrity is when they have a poor attitude to learning. They are certain in what
they know and are not willing to learn more. This keeps them in the same place while others keep growing. Keep an open
mind and be a lifelong learner.
