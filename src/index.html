            </h2>
            <p class="text-gen pb-5">Mediocrity begins if you decide not to do anything, but it is within our power to change. 
              Most people don't do things that are in alignment with their goals. Even if they have a clear dream, they don't spend even 5 minutes a day trying to be closer to that goal. 
              They also don't understand the value of time. Don't wait for the moment you are more freer, more prepared, or have a certain 
              amount of money. If you want to succeed in something, there is no perfect time to start.

                between the Blooms and Weeds üå±üå∫ üå∏üåπ</h2>
              <p class="text-gen pb-5">"Blooms" is the flattering term for those who entered First High's Course 1 curriculum due to
                higher test scores in application ability, magic tolerance, and interference strength. 
                On the other hand, "Weeds" are the derogatory term applied to those who entered 
                Course 2. Although Course 1 students have personal instruction while the Course 2 
                students only study off terminals, the curriculum is the completely the same. This in no way 
                demonstrates institutional stratification  or superiority, but rather only that there is a shortage of
                instructors and faculty. Inherent magic talent can be a result of various
                factors such as genetics, opportunity, and socioeconomic status. But none of those factors can 
                outshine one's ability (domain-specific technical expertise and knowledge acquired in a field), 
                learnability (capacity to learn new things - function of IQ and curiosity),
                likability (emotional intelligence and people-skills), and drive (dispositional level of ambition).</p>

              <p class="text-gen pb-5">In the day I work as a clerk at <a href="https://spy-x-family.fandom.com/wiki/Berlint_City_Hall">Berlint City Hall</a>, 
                in the night I work as a "Contractor" for <a href="https://spy-x-family.fandom.com/wiki/Garden">Garden</a>,
                and now I'm a new loving mother for the Forger family. Each day I'm improving and finding a balance
                between work and family time. I am so lucky to have <a href="https://spy-x-family.fandom.com/wiki/Loid_Forger">Loid</a>
                as my husband and <a href="https://spy-x-family.fandom.com/wiki/Anya_Forger">Anya</a> as my daughter as they
                have been super patient with me as I adjust to my new environment. I'm not confident in my abilities
                and I'm not good at anything besides cleaning. Recently, I've been asking 
                <a href="https://spy-x-family.fandom.com/wiki/Camilla">Camilla</a> for cooking lessons so 
                I can be a better mother. I also have a impulsive tendency to solve my problems through "cleaning". 
                Despite all the challenges, having a family amidst it all is tremendously rewarding. So how can one
                balance their work and family life? Avoid distractions - even when so many things are vying for your
                attention. Be nimble - whether its free time, exercise, or work. And finally, always keep in mind of
                not what we can measure but what matters.</p>

                That is why we must strive for serenity, mental strength, and inner peace. The greatest tip to
