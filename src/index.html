            <p class="text-gen pb-5">Mediocrity begins if you decide not to do anything, but it is within our power to change. 
              Most people don't do things that are in alignment with their goals. Even if they have a clear dream, they don't spend even 5 minutes a day trying to be closer to that goal. 
              They also don't understand the value of time. Don't wait for the moment you are more freer, more prepared, or have a certain 
              amount of money. If you want to succeed in something, there is no perfect time to start.
